+                 !ℹ️ Additional Information!
+  I made this out of pure boredom and frustration with the amount of websites I had to open just to access Clever, so I built this text-based launcher.
+  Please let me know if you have any recommendations or specific websites you'd like me to add.
+  Version of this code is in Python 3.13
+  Thank you!>
